Define a public function void movePlayer(int dx, int dy) which will move the Robot by units dx in the x direction (width-wise) and units dy in the y direction (height-wise) if the game is in PLAYING state then checks for the win or lose conditions and updates the game state internally.

Define a public function void printGrid() which will print out the grid with all the spots represented as '_' (underscore character), Robot player represented as 'P' (if the player is on a goal or obstacle spot then display 'P' as well), goal represented as 'G' and obstacles represented as 'O' (alphabetic letter O and not zero). e.g a 4x6 grid at the start of the game with only one obstacle placed at (2,2) before the player has moved will look like this:
